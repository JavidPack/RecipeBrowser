[h1]Recipe Browser![/h1]
Recipe Browser is an indispensable mod for any player. It provides a service to the user that the Guide could only dream of providing. [img]https://i.imgur.com/420S4WA.gif[/img] With Recipe Browser, you have access to powerful tools to help you plan out what items you want to craft. You'll be able to quickly find items that you can craft with the items in your possession, even if it takes several intermediate crafting steps.

[h1]How to Use[/h1]
To use, first you need to assign some hotkeys. Make sure to go into the Keybindings menu and assign hotkeys. The "Toggle Recipe Browser" hotkey is necessary, the other 2 are useful but somewhat optional. The "Query Hovered Item" hotkey streamlines checking recipes and the "Toggle Favorited Recipes Window" is useful when using the favorited recipes feature.

The main window consists of several tabs. You can click on the tabs to visit each tool. You can resize the window as well. The Help tab explains each tool in greater detail, be sure to check it out.

[h1]Recipes[/h1]
This tool allows you to quickly explore all recipes in the game. You can place an item in the query slot to find recipes using or resulting in that item. You can also search and filter with the various options in the window to discover recipes you'd like to work towards. Crafting stations and recipe conditions for a selected recipe are listed at the bottom. The color will be red or green showing if the player is near one or not. The right side will show any NPC that drops the selected item. Double Click on an NPC to visit the Bestiary. Double Clicking on a Recipe or Ingredient will populate the query slot with the item, great for traversing crafting trees for items with multiple levels of crafting. Alt-click on a recipe to favorite a recipe, see Favorite section below.

[h1]Craft[/h1]
This tool can be used to craft recipes, even recipes that require multiple steps to achieve! In the Recipes tool, right click on any recipe to bring up this tool. Recipes with the yellow background can be crafted via multiple steps. For example, if you have gold and iron ore and click on the Gold Watch recipe, this tool will show you the multiple steps needed to craft gold and iron ore, followed by crafting chains, and finally the gold watch itself. You can also enable the Loot option to allow farming as part of the multi-step process. Simply find and kill the specified enemies to farm the needed ingredient. By default, all crafting stations that you have seen will be available for the extended crafting paths. If you enable the Missing Stations option, unseen crafting stations will also be shown. See the Help tab for more information on this tool.
